# FGLIO

This repo contains the code of Factor Graph Accelerator for LiDAR-Inertial Odometry.

To run the demo, use python to run `localization_demo.py`.

The contents in `hw_unit` are C/C++ code that can be synthesized into hardware. You can use high-level synthesis (HLS) to convert them into HDL.
